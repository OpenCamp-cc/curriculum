## Where do I start?

Whether you are attending open camp or browsing the materials by yourself, please
start by reading the materials in [Week 0][week-0].

## Design Principles

open camp is a new online coding bootcamp focused on training Software
Developers focused on being open, challenging, and most importantly, affordable.

We adopt a flipped classroom model, where readings and assignments are
pre-assigned weekly and our live sessions are designed for students to take the
lead on the discussions.

Week 1 is designated as the "soft landing week", meaning that it does not yet
require students to be fully prepared prior to class. The flipped classroom
model fully kicks in from Week 2 onwards.


We are actively working on further reducing the tuition fees and even making it
completely free for our students. Please reach out to
[Victor](mailto:victor@opencamp.cc) if you are interested in collaborating.
