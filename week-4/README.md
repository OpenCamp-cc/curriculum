## Open Camp Week 4

In Week 4 (W4), we will take a break from HTML and CSS to try two programming
languages: Python and JavaScript.

Both languages are popular for different reasons:
- Python is commonly used for Data related industries, such as Data Analysis, Data Science, and building AI related applications
  - Python is also a popular language for building web sites, especially for Backend
- JavaScript is a popular language for building websites
  - It is also the only programming language that can be run natively on our web browsers, which makes it the de facto language when it comes to building for the Frontend.

At the end of this week, you should be able to do the following:

- Write simple Python and JavaScript code to achieve the same things
- Create a git repository on GitHub to store your code
