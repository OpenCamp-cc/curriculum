## Assignment #1: Create a simple personal website pt. 1

### Overview

It is now time for you to start writing some code! HTML is one of the key
concepts you must learn in order to build websites.

In Assignment #1, you start with a base HTML template provided by us that you
will edit to include your own personal information. Use this opportunity to get
used to editing and writing code on VSCode, as it will be your best buddy
throughout your learning journey.

You may notice that the website doesn't look very... nice. In Assignment #2, we
will use CSS to style the website to look nice and proper.
