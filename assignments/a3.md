## Assignment #3: Employee Form

### Overview

Forms are widely used on the web, from simple ones such as Google's search box,
to complicated ones with tons of filters.

In this assignment, you will be building a form for an employee management
system (or HR system), specifically a form to add new employees.

You will be using this form again in future assignments, where you will add
interactivity with JavaScript.

### Instructions

make this page look professional.
