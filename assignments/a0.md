## Assignment #0: Setup VSCode

### Overview

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a code editor, which is one of the key tools you
will be using to write code throughout the entire bootcamp. There are many other
code editors out there, but for this bootcamp we will be using one of the most
popular code editor known as VS Code.

In Assignment #0, you will be setting up VS Code on your computer so you can
start writing code on your own computer, and you will be given a simple HTML
file to test that everything is working.

### Instructions

1. Create a folder or directory anywhere you like on your computer, and name it "open camp"
  - This is where you will be storing all your work and assignments during the duration of the Bootcamp

2. [Download and Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - Windows: Download `x64` from the `User Installer`
    - macOS: If you are not sure if your laptop has a Intel or Apple Silicon chip, download `Universal`

3. Open VS Code after installing it
4. Open the folder or directory you have created in step 1 in VS Code (File → Open Folder)
5. Create a file named test.html, and paste the following into the file using VS Code

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>HTML Test File</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>If you can see this in your browser...</h1>
    <p>... it means that you got the test file to work!</p>
    <p>Now you can get started on your first assignment.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- Open the file (test.html) with your web browser: use Explorer (Windows) or
  Finder (macOS) to find test.html, right click → open with your web browser
