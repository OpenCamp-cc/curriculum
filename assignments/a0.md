## Assignment #0: Self-Introduction, Setup VSCode and Soucetree

### Overview

In Assignment #0, you will be introducing yourself to your fellow students,
and setting up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Sourcetree on your computer so
you can start writing code on your own computer. You will be given a simple
HTML file to test that everything is working.

VS Code is a text editor, which is one of the key tools you will be using to
write code throughout the entire bootcamp. There are many other code editors out
there, but for this bootcamp we will be using one of the most popular code
editor known as VS Code.

Sourcetree is a tool that allows you to work with Git repositories. All our code
and learning materials, including this file that you are reading on, are stored
in Git repositories. Git repositories allow you to version control your code, so
you can easily revert changes, and has built-in tooling to help you collaborate
with other developers who might be working on the same code changes.

You will be using VS Code in W1, and Sourcetree in W3.

**Installing and Testing VS Code**

1. Create a folder or directory anywhere you like on your computer, and name it "open camp"
  - This is where you will be storing all your work and assignments during the duration of the Bootcamp

2. [Download and Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - Windows: Download `x64` from the `User Installer`
    - macOS: If you are not sure if your laptop has a Intel or Apple Silicon chip, download `Universal`

3. Open VS Code after installing it
4. Open the folder or directory you have created in step 1 in VS Code (File → Open Folder)
5. Create a file named test.html, and paste the following into the file using VS Code

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>HTML Test File</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>If you can see this in your browser...</h1>
    <p>... it means that you got the test file to work!</p>
    <p>Now you can get started on your first assignment.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- Open the file (test.html) with your web browser: use Explorer (Windows) or
  Finder (macOS) to find test.html, right click → open with your web browser

You should see something similar to the screenshot above in your browser: if so,
congratulations, your VS Code is now ready to help you write code and complete
your assignments.

**Installing Sourcetree**

1. Head over to [Sourcetree's website][sourcetree] and download it for either macOS or Windows.
2. Open the installer and install Sourcetree

You are done. We will focus on Git and Sourcetree in W3.
