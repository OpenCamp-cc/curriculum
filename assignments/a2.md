## Assignment #2: Create a simple personal website pt. 2

### Overview

We will now extend upon [Assignment 1][a1] by adding CSS to our personal
website to make it look more interesting.

In this assignment, you are given the flexibility to customize the look and feel
of your personal website using CSS, with just a few requirements that you have
to follow.

### Instructions

Pre-requisite(s):
- Complete [Assignment #1][a1]

**Requirements:**
1. Your Interests: use squares instead of a disc for each list item (hint: read up on [list-style-type][list-style-type])
2. Show a picture of each location that visited or wish to visit. Add a fourth
column named `Picture`. The picture must be 400px wide and 400px tall (use CSS to set this)
3. Customize how the table looks (eg. background color, width, height, etc.) to your liking 

Apart from the 3 requirements above, you are welcome to customize the page to your liking. Take this chance to explore new
HTML or CSS that you may not have used before.
