## Assignment #5: Grid and Flexbox Challenge

### Overview

Grid and Flexbox are common techniques used to construct various layouts that
you commonly see online. In this assignment, you will be using both techniques
to construct various layouts and see how they can be combined together to
form more complex layouts.

### Instructions

Recreate **one** of the following layouts using a combination of Gridbox and
Flexbox: both must be used, you can't just use one of them.

**Layout 1**

For images, you may use [Lorem Picsum][lorem-picsum] to generate random images.


### Hints

- Draw out how the grid and flexbox will look like on paper first before you start coding
