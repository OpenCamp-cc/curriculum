## Assignment #8: GitHub For Your Code

### Overview

In [A6][a6], you forked and clone a remote repository to your local computer to
make changes, and send changes as PRs. In this assignment, you will be creating
your own repository to host your own code, specifically code from [A7][a7].

If you have yet to complete the optional assignment in [A6][a6], please take
some time to complete it now: [Hello World][gh-hello-world] on GitHub.

**Instructions**

- Create a new repository on GitHub via their web interface
- Name the repository `opencamp-a7`
- Clone the repository locally to your company using Sourcetree
- Place the code you wrote for [A7][a7] in this repository, and commit them
    - For example, if you used Python for part 1 and JavaScript for part 2, you should have two files in the repository: `part1.py` and `part2.js`.
- Commit your code and push it up to your repository on GitHub
- Add a README file to your repository by following [GitHub's README guide][gh-readme], commit the changes and push it to your repository
