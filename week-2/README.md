## Open Camp Week 2

In Week 2 (W2), we will continue with more HTML and CSS, and you will get
started with the 2nd developer tool: Git (using Sourcetree).

The pace and intensity will really kick up a notch from W2 onwards, so please
make sure that you have time to go through all the materials and complete the
assignments.

At the end of this week, you should be able to do the following:

- Use HTML and CSS to build forms for various purposes (eg. registration)
- Solve simple algorithm questions (without coding)

[freeCodeCamp][fcc] is a completely free website for learning how to code. We
will be using several of their exercises as learning materials, while you
complete tougher challenges through open camp assignments to really test your
ability.

You may wish to collect freeCodeCamp's certification along the way for some of
their courses, but this will require you to complete the course at your own
time.
